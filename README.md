It is a rigid pendulum. The inextensible rods of length  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L"> has zero mass. The  mass at the end is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M">, which will be considered as punctual. The pendulum is therefore fixed in O. The movement takes place in a plane of horizontal <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> and vertical <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y"> coordinates. The angle that the pendulum makes with the vertical is denoted  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta">. This angle is noted positively counterclockwise.

In numerical analysis, the Runge窶適utta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the well-known routine called the Euler Method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations.

The most widely known member of the Runge窶適utta family is generally referred to as "RK4", the "classic Runge窶適utta method" or simply as "the Runge窶適utta method".

We're using this method here.

#### Use ``g++ main.cpp class.cpp -o main && ./main`` to run.
